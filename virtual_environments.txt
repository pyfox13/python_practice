virtual environments:


its like a way to isolte the python packages. It helps t run mulitple projects locally without causing dipendency erros.


ProjectA - which uses python 3.1 
ProjectB - which uses python 3.8


when you install python globally ( ont isolated in  a virutal environment or a docker container ) .


- vritual environment is like a sandbox- a self contained directory that has:
1. it s own python interpreter
2. Its own set of installed packages.

This helps us to 
1. avoid conflicts between project dipendencies.
2. Use different versions of packages for different porjects.
3. Keep your global python clean


command to create virtual environment

python3 -m venv <name of the virtual environment>



JSON- 

JSON refers to Javascript Object Notation. It is a format for sending and receving data.

You can think of JSON as a simple, human-readable text format that looks like a python dict.

{
    "name": "avishkar",
    "age": 21
}

JSON is used by nearly every web API:
1. its easy to read.
2. Its easy to parse( for machines)
3. Its a language-independent. (it works very will with python, js, java, etc)


Why do we use json when calling an api
when you call a web api, you are actually asking the server for information or sending it data.

That server needs a standout format it can understand, and JSON is the standard.

an example of sending data to sever.


import requests

data = {
    "name": "avishkar,
    "age:: 21
}

response = requests.post("https://api.healthcare.com/register, json=data)
